        <img src="https://assets.traveltriangle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Shangumugham-Beach_8th-jan.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Shangumugham Beach is an incredible beach situated very near to the city airport. This beach of clear blue waters and white sand is a ravishing place to relax and spend your time in ethereal surroundings. The beach is extremely clean and has maintained its raw beauty that makes it one of the best places to see in Trivandrum.

            The beach also houses a little Devi temple. Sunset views are just matchless and very adorable from the beach. The tranquil beach is quite long and very charismatic. The best part of this beach is it isn’t as crowded as other popular beaches in the city – except perhaps during the sunset time when a number of people visit to view the enchanting sunset scenes here.</p>
