        </h2>
        <img src="https://www.keralatourism.org/kasaragod/investment/images/top-attraction/large/bekal-fort.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Bekal Fort is a historical structure built in the 17th century and has itself become part of an identity of the district. It is situated in Pallikara village of Kasaragod on a headland that spans up to 35 km.It is believed that the fort was originally constructed by rulers of the ancient Kadampa dynasty and the power changed hands over the years to Kolathiri Rajas, Hyder Ali, Tipu Sultan and finally to the British East India Company. The lofty, circular laterite structure of the fort that stands at a height of 130 feet is shaped like a giant keyhole. The walls around rise to 12 metres in height. The highlights include tall observation towers which presumably would have been occupied by gigantic cannons until a few centuries ago, a water tank with its flight of steps and a tunnel that opens towards the south. The architectural beauty of the fort also met the defence requirements of various rulers,which was the main reason for the fortâ€™s existence. There are also some pilgrim attractions nearby like the Lord Hanuman temple and an old Mosque which is believed to be built by Tippu Sultan.The Bekal beach is only a kilometre away from the fort which offers an enticing view of the imposing fort. It has now become a favoured destination for weddings, ad shoots and filmmakers for its picturesque location. This is the largest and the best-preserved fort in the district and is now maintained by the Archaeological Department of Government of India.

        <img src="https://www.keralatourism.org/kasaragod/investment/images/top-attraction/large/Chandragiri-Fort.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Chandragiri Fort is another historical landmark in the district situated in the south-east of Kasaragod town. The Chandragiri River that flows nearby once bordered the kingdoms of Kolathunadu and Tulunadu. The origin of the fort goes back to the times of Keladi Nayakas who took control of the region as the Vijayanagara Empire fell. Shivappa Nayak secured his empire by renovating and constructing many forts around the area one of which is Chandragiri which was built in the 17th century. The remnants of the fort which can be seen on a small hill overlook the estuary where the Payaswini River joins the Arabian Sea. The old laterite walls around the fort still bear marks of cannonball attacks. The ancient Kizhur Sastha temple and a mosque are situated near the fort. The fort is now maintained by the Archaeology Department of India. Boat services are available here that will take you to nearby islands and palm groves. Speed boat rides,houseboat cruises, island camping and wildlife tours in the hinterlands can also be arranged.</p>
