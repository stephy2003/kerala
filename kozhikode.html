        <p>Situated on the Malabar coast and endowed with natural beauty, Kozhikode beach should be a must in the itinerary of your visit to the city. This beach is renowned for the sunsets that tourists throng here to enjoy. Though the water is muddy and not suitable for swimming, still the stunning view of the Arabian Sea that the lighthouse offers more than compensates for the shortcoming.

            Payannakal, Putiyappa, Elathur, Beypore, all these beaches are part of the long stretch of Kozhikode beach. This beach lies on the western side of the city and is easily accessible through the four roads in the city. </p>
        <h2>2.Kakkadampoyil Waterfall</h2>
        <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/thrillophilia/image/upload/c_fill,dpr_1.0,f_auto,fl_progressive.strip_profile,g_center,h_460,q_auto,w_768/v1/filestore/29amrz6tl6jd83tehxotakp7ji63_1589362854_shutterstock_1507272881.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Kakkadampoyil is a sleepy village in Koodaranhi panchayat in Kozhikode. This village has sprung up as an idyllic tourist spot because of the scenic beauty and the famous waterfall of the same name. The waterfall that lies on the Kuruvan River has been drawing visitors with the abundance of flora and fauna, who love a break from city life.

            The misty mountains and the hills surrounding it has given this place another name “Mini Gavi”, by drawing a parallel with the Gavi forests. One of the top places to visit in Kozhikode, the waterfall and Pazhassi caves are the main tourist attractions here. The “Mini Gavi” forest is inhabited with elephants, tigers, birds, and butterflies and is the chief attraction for nature lovers and wildlife photographers. This is the perfect spot for trekking. </p>
